                <div class="subtitle">What I learned covering the world’s biggest country for The Economist</div>
            </div>

            <div class="introduction">
                <p>This past year, I changed vocations from journalist to PhD student. The last of my three years as a journalist was the best. I traveled across 10 states and over 30 cities and villages in India, covering the world’s most populous country and history’s largest election. My friends have been urging me to reflect on what it was like for a while, so I’m happy to finally share this essay. The nature of my experience with India resists a singular thesis. But if I had to name one lesson it is that Indian society and the state, enormous yet decentralized and only half-modernised, is filled with amorphous and private information that empowers the myriad information brokers who see reality for what it is. Muddling through that illegibility and finding those oftentimes unexpected individuals was my job--and made writing there so rewarding.</p>

                <p>Indeed, the quantity of international resources that go into understanding India on the ground pales in comparison to its importance. While China is upending the world order today, think on a longer time horizon. India has 1.4bn people and counting, is compounding at a 7% growth rate, just surpassed Japan to become the world’s 4th biggest economy, and it is plausible it will become the biggest within my lifetime. If you have feedback or questions, I’d love to know: asramani@mit.edu.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>India's demographic profile represents one of its greatest economic assets. With a median age of approximately 28 years, the country possesses the world's largest working-age population<a href="#footnote1" id="footnote-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a>. This demographic dividend, however, is not automatically convertible into economic growth—it requires strategic policy interventions and substantial investments in human capital development.</p>

                    <p>The potential of India's young population is evident in several key sectors. The technology industry, for instance, has already demonstrated how demographic advantages can translate into global competitiveness. However, realizing the full potential of this demographic dividend requires addressing significant challenges in education, skill development, and job creation<a href="#footnote2" id="footnote-ref-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a>.</p>

                    <p>Labor force participation rates, particularly among women, remain concerningly low. Female labor force participation has actually declined in recent decades, representing a significant underutilization of human resources. Addressing this challenge through policy reforms, cultural shifts, and infrastructure development could substantially amplify India's demographic advantages.</p>

            <div class="section" id="digital-transformation">
                <div class="section-header">2. Digital Transformation and Innovation</div>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>India's digital transformation story is perhaps one of the most remarkable economic developments of the 21st century. The country has leapfrogged traditional infrastructure constraints through innovative digital solutions, creating new pathways for economic inclusion and growth<a href="#footnote3" id="footnote-ref-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system exemplifies this transformation, processing billions of transactions monthly and enabling financial inclusion for previously unbanked populations. This digital infrastructure has created the foundation for a broader fintech ecosystem that serves both domestic needs and global markets.</p>

                    <p>However, the digital divide remains a significant challenge. While urban India increasingly resembles developed economies in terms of digital adoption, rural areas often lack basic connectivity infrastructure. Bridging this gap is essential for ensuring that digital transformation benefits all segments of society and contributes to inclusive growth.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Infrastructure development represents both India's greatest challenge and its most significant opportunity for economic acceleration. The country's infrastructure needs are enormous, spanning transportation, energy, water, and telecommunications systems<a href="#footnote4" id="footnote-ref-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a>.</p>

                    <p>Recent years have seen substantial government investments in infrastructure projects, from high-speed rail corridors to renewable energy installations. These investments not only address immediate infrastructure gaps but also create employment opportunities and stimulate economic activity across multiple sectors.</p>

                    <p>The financing of infrastructure development remains a critical challenge. Public resources alone are insufficient to meet India's infrastructure needs, necessitating innovative financing mechanisms and greater private sector participation. The development of infrastructure bonds, public-private partnerships, and foreign investment frameworks will be crucial for sustaining infrastructure development momentum.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>India's economic structure has evolved uniquely among major developing economies, with services becoming the dominant sector before manufacturing reached its full potential. This "services-first" development path has created both advantages and challenges for future growth<a href="#footnote5" id="footnote-ref-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a>.</p>

                    <p>The services sector, particularly information technology and business process outsourcing, has demonstrated India's capability to compete globally in knowledge-intensive industries. However, manufacturing remains underdeveloped relative to other economies at similar development levels, limiting job creation for the broader population.</p>

                    <p>Recent policy initiatives, including "Make in India" and production-linked incentive schemes, aim to strengthen manufacturing capabilities. Success in this area could significantly accelerate job creation and export growth, while reducing dependence on imports for essential goods.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>India's integration into global value chains represents a critical dimension of its economic strategy. The country's approach to trade policy has evolved significantly, balancing domestic industry protection with the benefits of international competition and collaboration<a href="#footnote6" id="footnote-ref-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a>.</p>

                    <p>Recent geopolitical developments have created new opportunities for India to position itself as an alternative manufacturing destination for global supply chains. The "China+1" strategy adopted by many multinational corporations could benefit India, provided it can offer competitive manufacturing capabilities and reliable business environments.</p>

                    <p>However, trade integration also presents challenges, particularly for domestic industries that may struggle to compete with international players. Developing effective adjustment mechanisms and support systems for affected workers and regions will be essential for maintaining social cohesion while pursuing greater global integration.</p>

                    <p>Digital governance initiatives have improved service delivery and reduced opportunities for corruption in many areas. The implementation of goods and services tax (GST) has simplified India's complex tax structure, though implementation challenges remain.</p>

                    <p>India's economic future depends on successfully navigating multiple complex challenges while capitalizing on significant opportunities. The country's demographic advantages, technological capabilities, and growing global influence provide a strong foundation for continued growth.</p>

                    <p>However, realizing India's full economic potential requires sustained commitment to reforms across multiple dimensions—from education and infrastructure to governance and environmental sustainability. The choices made in the coming decade will largely determine whether India can join the ranks of developed economies.</p>

                    <p>The path forward is neither predetermined nor without risks. Success will require adaptive policymaking, inclusive growth strategies, and the ability to balance competing priorities. Yet the potential rewards—for India and the global economy—make this journey one of the most significant economic stories of our time.</p>
